### Concept/Ideas

- The idea for this game is not fully fleshed out yet, but this is the basics of it so far.

- I want the game to be a 2 player fighting game, where each player can choose between 3-4 different character options, and each character will have unique stats and skills.

- Ideally, I want each player to be able to customize their character's stats (within a certain range), but I might instead create a few different settings presets that would change the stats of both players, and then the players have to agree on one.

- Each character will have 2-3 unique weapons that they can switch between. In addition to that, all characters will have the ability to set traps, though the specific trap will vary based on the character.

- Each weapon will have a unique ability that can be used once every so often

- The two players will be able to move freely around the screen and attack each other, with the goal of killing the other character.

- The "field" will have a bunch of platforms for players to jump and navigate on/around. Players will be able to jump up though the bottom of the platform, but will not be able to drop down through the platform.

- I also want to add multiple levels, which would allow players to do a best of X match. When this setting is applied, the winner of a round would receive a slight upgrade/buff **OR** the loser gets a slight disadvantage.

- Lastly, I want to add a stats screen at the end of each game, as well as an abbreviated stats screen between rounds.
